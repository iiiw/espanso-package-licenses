# espanso-package-licenses

License text and boilerplate for popular open source licenses.
Generate license text and headers on the fly.


## Usage

Create a LICENSE file at the root of your project. Trigger `:lapa2` to insert:

```
    Apache License
    Version 2.0, January 2004
    http://www.apache.org/licenses/

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

    1. Definitions.

    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution
    as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
    ...
```

To place the header for the Apache License 2.0, trigger `:lhapa2` from the first line of your source file:

```
    Copyright 2021 <owner>

    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
    ...
```


## Triggers and Licenses

The triggers are `:l<ID>` and `:lh<ID>`, for license text and header. The `:lhc<ID>` trigger additionally wraps the header in a C-style block comment.

`ID` is an abbreviation of the [SPDX short identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

The selection of licenses is based on <https://opensource.org/licenses>. They are retrieved from the [SPDX license list data repository](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data). Please file an issue, if you need other licenses.

## Placeholders

Some licenses use placeholders. The year placeholder is always replaced by the current year. If the license has an owner placeholder, the cursor is placed before it.

| Placeholder                                           | Substitution                        |
| ---                                                   | ---                                 |
| `<year>`                                              | This year (`%Y` in strftime format) |
| `<owner>`, `<name of author>`, `<copyright holder> â€¦` | Cursor placed here ==>`|<owner>`    |


## Installation

From source repo:

```
espanso install licenses https://github.com/iiiw/espanso-package-licenses --external
```

## Caveats

1. Licenses are downloaded each time. If the connection is down, the expansion silently fails.
2. It takes a few seconds for the cursor to move back to the (owner) placeholder. Do not leave the active window until the cursor has arrived.
3. Not tested on Windows. If [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) is installed, the needed tools (curl, sed and fold) should be in place. Feedback welcome.
